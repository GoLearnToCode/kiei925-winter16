# KIEI-925: Startup Programming and Management

## Instructor: Brian Eng – [b-eng@kellogg.northwestern.edu](mailto:b-eng@kellogg.northwestern.edu)

This course is geared for entrepreneurs and non-programmers who want to build their own web apps and manage a software product lifecycle. Students will build a project in small steps, learning the fundamentals of computer programming and modern web app development along the way.

### Learning Goals

1. The Ruby on Rails web framework for building web applications
2. Key concepts and patterns in modern web programming regardless of framework
3. Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on your teams
4. The core principles of agile team management and best practices
5. Prioritize features more efficiently by developing a better feel for their costs

### Student Expectations

This is an empowering course, but it is not an easy course. Students should expect to spend 8-10 hours a week on project assignments. Students are highly encouraged to work with a partner to help each other on their projects.
Attendance at lectures is paramount. Beginner-level materials for building web apps as scarce. There is no textbook that can act as a substitute. If you miss two lectures you will probably never catch up.

### Computer Requirements

Students must own or have access to a modern computer that is capable of running the Ruby on Rails framework. MacBooks are highly recommended, though most PCs can be made to work as well. Detailed installation instructions for both platforms will be provided at the first class.

### Assignments and Grading

Students must build a project of their choosing throughout the quarter as their final project. Students are encouraged to work in groups for all assignments including the final project, but each student must turn in their own project code that they developed themselves.

- **Homework will be worth 60% of your grade** – 6 homework assignments @ 10% each
- There will be a **mid-term exam with 15%** (week 6)
- The **final project is worth 25%**
