Do the interactive Ruby tutorial at [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org)

1. Inside your code folder, create a new Rails application called ```poker``` by typing ```rails new poker```
2. In your Rails project, support the following URL: ```http://localhost:3000/poker``` and simulate the dealing of a 5-card hand of poker (i.e. five random playing cards) – use [https://github.com/kiei925-winter15/poker](https://github.com/kiei925-winter15/poker) for a good starting point. **The cards do not have to be unique.** *Note: do not attempt to clone this repository and rename/copy the files into your own. Create a new Rails project per Step 1 and use this repository as a guideline only.*
3. Display the cards as images – these are available publicly, following this naming convention – ```http://golearntocode.com/images/cards/number_of_suit.png```. For example, ```http://golearntocode.com/images/cards/10_of_diamonds.png``` is the image for the 10 of diamonds.
4. Commit your repository with your Github account so that it's accessible via ```http://github.com/<your username>/poker```
