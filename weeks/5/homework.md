### Full implementation of the "golden seven" actions

Complete the following requirements for a total possible score of 10 points:

1. **Important!** Open up your config/application.rb file, and modify the section between ```class Application... end``` so that it reads like the following (there's a lot of commented-out code in there currently):

```
class Application < Rails::Application
  config.action_controller.permit_all_parameters = true
end
```

2. Complete the new/create/edit/update/destroy actions for one of the resources in your final project

### Next Friday (May 8) is the mid-term!

45 minutes at the end of class, closed book.
