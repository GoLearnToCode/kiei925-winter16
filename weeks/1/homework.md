### Start on Your Final Project

- Pick an app idea
- Create a folder in your code directory called **week1**
- Add a README.md file, writing at least 5 user stories for your app - see https://github.com/kiei925-spring15/stories for an example
- Create a domain model (in Excel) for your app – at least 3 models – and add the Excel file to your **week1** folder
- Commit and push your changes so that I can grab your user stories and domain model from ```http://github.com/<your username>/week1```
