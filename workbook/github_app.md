  <h1>How To: Install the GitHub App</h1>
</div>

The GitHub App provides a user-friendly interface for syncing files to and from GitHub.  You don't have to use the app, however.  You might prefer to learn how to use the command-line interface instead, and in fact is required if you choose an online development environment with [Nitrous.IO](http://nitrous.io).

* First, get a free [GitHub account](http://github.com).
* Next, follow the [Getting Started Guide for Windows](http://windows.github.com/help.html) or [for Mac](http://mac.github.com/help.html).
* If you need help sync'ing your code, don't miss the chapter on how to synchronize repositories on [Windows](https://help.github.com/articles/synchronizing-repositories) or [Mac](https://help.github.com/articles/how-can-i-push-or-pull).

Remember: **repository** is just a fancy word for **folder**.
