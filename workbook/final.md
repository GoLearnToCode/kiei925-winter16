# Final Project Requirements

Every student is required to turn in a Ruby on Rails web application. You're highly encouraged to work in study groups, but each student must turn in their own project.

**Due Date: Monday, June 8, 11:59pm**

Late work cannot be accepted.

### How To Turn In Your Project

Your final project must be contained in a repository named ***final*** inside of your GitHub account.

### Choose a Project

You can choose your own idea (preferred) or you can choose from one of these idea templates. Please inform me of your project idea by Week 5.

The three idea templates are:

**Social Sharing Site.** Something like Pinterest. Users can sign up for accounts, submit content, content is categorized or tagged, they "follow" other users, and can comment on other user's submissions.

**Content Management System.** Like Tumblr, or a newspaper publication service. Users sign up for an account as a publisher or reader. A publisher can post articles of various media types: text, images, videos, and maps, and are organized into sections based on a category, tag, publish date, or some other criteria. Readers can post comments anonymously or under their account.

**Event Organizer.** Like Evite or Meetup.com. A way to invite groups of people to events at various locations.

### Web App Grading Criteria

Projects can achieve a maximum of 25 points.

Each requirement is worth up to 4 points. Earn up to 20 points by fulfilling any 5 requirements from the list below.

Up to another 5 points can be awarded based on the intructor's subjective evaluation, based on code readability, application of standard Ruby idioms where appropriate, and overall execution.

### Requirements Menu

- Implement at least one many-to-many association
- Implement at least three models
- Demonstrate best-practice use of Rails MVC architecture
- Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out
- Populate the database via seed data
- Mashup data from an external web service (maps, social networks, open government data). Note: Using the built-in weather functionality does not qualify unless it is materially enhances your project.
- Use at least three validation rules
- Proper use of a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation (grid usage, form elements, or other components)
- Deploy your app to a live internet URL
