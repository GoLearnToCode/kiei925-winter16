# Final Project Requirements

Every student is required to turn in a Ruby on Rails web application. You're highly encouraged to work in groups, but each student must turn in their own project.

**Due Date: Friday, March 18, 11:59pm**

Late work will not be accepted.

### How To Turn In Your Project

Your final project must be contained in a workspace in your C9 account. Please send an email to Garrett when your project is ready for review; include the name of your final project workspace and your live URL (if applicable).

### Web App Grading Criteria

Projects can achieve a maximum of 25 points.

Each requirement is worth up to 4 points. Earn up to 20 points by fulfilling any 5 requirements from the list below.

Up to another 5 points can be awarded based on the instructor's subjective evaluation, based on code readability, application of standard Ruby idioms where appropriate, and overall execution.

### Requirements Menu

- Implement at least three models, with declarative associations (i.e. has_many, belongs_to), and at least one many-to-many association. Use at least five model validation rules.
- Using resource-based routing (i.e. the golden seven), implement at least three resources.
- Authentication and authorization. Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. Protect sensitive parts of your application through the use of a before_action. Implement role-based authorization to allow different types of users to access different parts of your application.
- Adhere to best practices in modern software development (e.g. DRY) by eliminating duplicate code in your application through the use of view partials and before_actions.
- Proper use of a CSS framework like Bootstrap (grid usage, form elements, or other components). Use Bootstrap alerts to inform users of state changes (e.g. successful log-in, database record creation).
- Populate the database via CSV import or load data from an external web service using RubyGems.Note: Using the APIs we've used in class (Forecast.io, Spotify, OMDB) does not qualify unless it is materially enhances your project.
- Deploy your app to Heroku. If working in a group, only one live deployment is required. Include your URL in your submission (i.e. your email to Garrett) for full credit.
